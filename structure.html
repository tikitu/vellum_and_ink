<h1>Structure in <i>Vellum</i> &amp; <i>Ink</i></h1>

<p>
I had some help from Hal himself: the thread
starts with him
<a href="https://twitter.com/hal_duncan/status/623323053540380672">complaining
about over-chaptering in a manuscript he's critiqueing</a>, and ends
with Official Terminology for describing his
&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/Hal_Duncan/status/623481056738603008">formalist
shenanigans</a>&rdquo;:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Novel (<i>Vellum</i>, <i>Ink</i>)</li>
<li>Volume (each novel has two)</li>
<li>Chapter</li>
<li>(Errata: see below)</li>
<li>Canto (within a chapter; has a title)</li>
<li>Verse (offset by whitespace)</li>
<li>(Paragraph, sentence: standard text-structure)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Hal would treat the &ldquo;Errata&rdquo;
sections <a href="https://twitter.com/Hal_Duncan/status/623479270019604480">as
chapter appendices</a>. I've represented them in the html as a header
level below Chapter and above Canto; I think this is fair to his
intention.
</p>

<p>
The printed and ebook editions also contain centered stars, which look
like they convey yet another level of hierarchical structure. In fact,
however, these are simply divisions between verses: when a verse
boundary coincides with a page boundary, there is no visible
whitespace division so the publishers added the stars to
indicate <i>the same</i> structural feature. These have been taken
over into the ebooks, where they are useless (since they generally no
longer coincide with the page boundaries) and misleading (for anyone
as obsessively attentive to structural cues as ourselves). I have
removed them from the html files.
