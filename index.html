<h1>Analysing <em>Vellum</em> (and eventually <em>Ink</em>)</h1>

<p>
Hal Duncan's duology <em>The Book of All Hours</em> (<em>Vellum</em>, 2005, and
<em>Ink</em>, 2007) is very complex, both in terms of its formal structure (it
uses <a href="structure.html">a structural hierarchy with seven levels</a>, and
<a href="fonts.html">three body text typefaces plus italic variants and a
  sans-serif</a>) and its content (it interweaves multiple lines of continuity,
not always in temporal order; the same characters recur across continuities but
with differences both cosmetic and significant). It's a lot of fun to chart
these features, and the complexity and richness of these books means the extra
study required to do so is rather rewarding.
</p>

<p>
Some folk I met on the internet are working on an <em>Annotated Book of All
Hours</em>. These bits and pieces are my contribution towards that effort.
</p>

<p>
This is very much a work in progress, and I'm working on the tools at the same
time as the material. Suggestions for improvement will be
<a href="https://github.com/tikitu/vellum_and_ink/issues">gratefully received</a>.
(This is an extremely part-time hobby, jammed into the cracks between full-time
work and helping raise a family: don't expect polish, and movement will be
slow.)
</p>

<p>
I've made a &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; of <em>Vellum</em> by copying the html
structure from an ebook and removing most of the text, leaving only headers
intact and a small amount of text from each paragraph to aid in orientation.
I'm working on a tool to let you fold this skeleton together with the text, if
you possess it: I've got an annotated version of the full text myself and it's
a rather fun object in its own right, but of course I can't give it to you
without doing Hal out of his rightful earnings (and presumably calling the
wrath of Macmillan's legal department down upon myself). In the meantime,
<a href="clipped.html">the skeleton</a> is not spectacularly useful but might
be interesting. The colours indicate the <a href="fonts.html">typefaces</a>,
and I hope to add more complex visualisations (continuity threads! character
correspondences!) as I find time.

Disclaimer: I believe the extensive excerpts posted here do not infringe on the
author's copyright, as they are for purposes of criticism and as they reproduce
the <em>structure</em> but very little of the <em>content</em> of the books.
If you have a legal claim to copyright on the works I discuss here and you
disagree with this interpretation, I will be glad to do what I can to address
your concern. Please <a href="https://github.com/tikitu">get in touch</a>.
