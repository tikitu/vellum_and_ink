<h1>Typefaces in <em>Vellum</em></h1>

<p>
<em>Vellum</em> uses three distinct body-text typefaces (in both roman
and italic variants), as well as a sans-serif. These are
clearly <em>somehow</em> linked to particular focus characters and/or
settings, but the precise relation is difficult to pin down.
</p>

<p>
Hal gave me some help on twitter: it seems the original idea was to
distinguish the &ldquo;modern-futuristic&rdquo; setting (2017 with
Phreedom as focus character; also described by Hal as &ldquo;cyberpunk
and mythic fantasy&rdquo; and &ldquo;fantastica&rdquo;) from
&ldquo;modernist&rdquo; Joycean technique (which first enters with
Seamus and Thomas in the trenches), but this was later expanded to
include a third category, splitting &ldquo;mythic&rdquo; out from the
&ldquo;fantastica&rdquo; category. These recollections should be taken
with a grain of salt, not just because of the Death of the Author but
also because it was a long time ago and Hal was responding
off-the-cuff on Twitter (he couldn't find the original mails to
Macmillan): at first he didn't remember that the original two-way split
was later extended to three. In any case the tidy categorisation he
suggests doesn't hold together very well past the first examples.
</p>

<p>
You can find the twitter exchange in replies
to <a href="https://twitter.com/ttikitu/status/622406799610806272">my
first question</a>. His most important observations are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/hal_duncan/status/622436076175671296">Primary
logic was w/ the shift that comes in at the trenches, from cyberpunk &
mythic fantasy to Joycean Modernist.</a>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/hal_duncan/status/622437837531652096">So,
you'd get: modern-futuristic (2017), mythic (Inanna & Dumuzi),
mundane-Modernist (WW1 > Spanish Civil War).</a>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this scheme (and my weakness for alliteration) I will
call the three typefaces &lsquo;modern&rsquo;, &lsquo;mythic&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;mundane&rsquo;. (The UK and US editions use different fonts
for the three styles, however Hal assured me that they follow the same
structure. I am working from the hardcover UK edition, published by
Macmillan in 2005.)
</p>

<p>I've annotated the entire text of <em>Vellum</em> to show the fonts used. I
can't give you that, of course, because it would massively violate the author's
copyright. But I believe I <em>can</em> give you an
<a href="clipped.html">annotated skeleton</a>, which might come in handy in
following the descriptions below. The three pastel-ish colours indicate the
three body-text fonts, while italics and sans-serif represent themselves.</p>

<h2>Volume one: The Lost Deus of Sumer</h2>

<p>
Below is a perhaps too exhaustive annotation of the details of where
the various typefaces are used in this volume. Let me try to summarise
a little. Some elements are simple:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The modern typeface is used consistently in the prologue and in
all errata sections in this volume (many of which follow the
continuity of the prologue).</li>
<li>Similarly reliably, the modern typeface is consistently used for
the &lsquo;modern-day&rsquo; continuity that begins with Phreedom in
Chapter 1, and picks up Thomas (her brother), Finnan (as she knows
him), Metatron, Madame Iris the tattoo artist, and Carter and Pechorin
(as agents of Metatron).</li>
<li>The mundane typeface is consistently used for Seamus Finnan's WWI
history (which takes in another Thomas Messenger, also called Tommy,
and Mad Jack Carter).</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will note I've said nothing yet about the mythic typeface. On the
surface this is quite obvious: it's used already in the first canto
of Chapter 1 for material apparently directly quoted from the myth of
Inanna's descent to the underworld. But things are not so
simple.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, some material from this myth appears interleaved within
verses set in the modern or mundane typefaces. In some places
(&ldquo;A Speck of Dirt Under a Fingernail&rdquo; and many others)
this material is placed in the same typeface as the verse it
&lsquo;intrudes upon&rsquo;, but set aside from it by italics. However
in the <em>first</em> canto in which we meet this technique,
&ldquo;Broken Minutes and Bent Hours&rdquo;, the mythic
material <em>is</em> rendered in the mythic typeface (although also in
italics). I suspect that one or other of these cases is in fact a
printing error, and since there are many more in which the mythic
material is <em>not</em> rendered in the mythic typeface, I must
presume that is the intention. (This disturbs my sense of tidiness:
you will observe this reaction in the notes below, which were written
before I attempted to summarise the entire system here.)
</p>

<p>
Complicating the picture still further, there is a subplot that
arguably could have been set in either the mythic <em>or</em> the
modern typefaces, but in fact is set in the mundane typeface. This is
the progress of Phreedom's backup plan when she &ldquo;enters the
underworld&rdquo; (i.e., takes the graving of Inanna, in the tattoo
parlour of Madame Iris).
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, this plan takes the form of an artificial
intelligence which Phreedom both grows and programs herself, and which
waits in a virtual reality museum tour until its timer runs out: being
Phreedom's continuity and cyberpunk would suggest the modern typeface
for this thread.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the software agent is a deliberate echo of Inanna's
servant Lady Shubur, the museum where she waits is a VR recreation of
a temple to Enlil (father of the gods), and her rescue plan is to
petition various mythic figures both faded (Enlil, Sin) and very much
alive (Metatron) for help in rescuing Phreedom: the mythic typeface
would not have seemed very out of place here, once the cyberpunk
trappings had faded into the background.
</p>

<p>
My suspicion is that this subplot is not in the modern typeface purely
to give the reader a bit more assistence in keeping it distinct from
the action surrounding Phreedom, as cantos and verses from the two
strands are often interwoven. And I imagine that the cyberpunk
material made it impossible to cast this in the mythic
typeface. Still, the result is something of a surprise.
</p>

<p>
That gives you some idea of the general structure. Let me finish with
a list of notable moments in typeface-chasing through the first volume of
<em>Vellum</em>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The start of Chapter 1, of course, with the introduction of
Inanna's myth, is the first sign that something interesting is going
on with the typography.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Golden Apples and Green Leaves&rdquo; contains the first
use of the mythic typeface for material that is not pure retelling of
myth: this material concerns Dumuzi/Tammuz escaping &ldquo;down into
the eternal tales of transformation&rdquo; and is clearly pivotal to
the metaphysical structure of the Vellum that Hal intends (as well as
for the resolution of Phreedom and Thomas' story).</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Lioness and the Gazelle&rdquo; uses typeface shifts to
reinforce a kind of doubled (or quadrupled) vision: the same scene is
presented once through the lens of myth and once as mundane WWI
experience, but both are further distinguished from their surroundings
by being set in italics.</li>
<li>&ldquo;An Empty Role of Rituals&rdquo; uses the mundane typeface
to signal that although it describes a character called Inanna, she
should not be too easily identified with the Inanna of the myth (in
fact she is the neolithic precursor of the story).</li>
<li>&ldquo;A Sleeve of Blood and Black&rdquo; weaves all three
typefaces together to show different facets of the graving Phreedom
receives: Inanna the neolithic villager, Inanna the queen of heaven,
and Phreedom Messenger herself, who &ldquo;[has] always been
Inanna&rdquo;.</li>
<li>In &ldquo;Inanna Rose&rdquo;, despite the action arguably being
purely and only the echo of mythic material, the typeface remains
modern. This lets Phreedom own her story, whatever its basis in mythic
archetypes. Given the humanist message of the work as a whole, I tend
to think this was a very deliberate (although rather subtle)
decision.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's probably enough. I warn you though: if you thought that was
long, look out below! You may want to skip to the <a href="#volume-2">overview
of Volume 2</a>.
</p>

<h3>Prologue: The Road of All Dust</h3>
<p>The entire prologue is in the modern typeface.
<h3>1: A Door Out of Reality</h3>
<h5 class="align-right">From the Great Beyond</h5>
<p>
Here begins the retelling of the Sumerian myth of Inanna's descent to
the underworld. This canto is in the mythic typeface, however
we will see later that this does not always apply even to material
that appears to quote the myth directly.
</p>
<h5 class="align-left">Thick with Trees and Thunderstorms</h5>
<p>
This canto introduces Phreedom, on &ldquo;August 4th, 2017. Sort
of.&rdquo; It is in the modern typeface: this appears to be what Hal
remembers as the &lsquo;canonical&rsquo; or &lsquo;standard&rsquo; use
of the typeface.
</p>
<h5 class="align-right">Whore of Babylon, Queen of Heaven</h5>
<p>
We return to Inanna's myth, in the mythic typeface.
</p>
<h5 class="align-left">A Sculpture of Time and Space</h5>
<p>
Phreedom, again in the modern typeface. Until now there has not been a
clear correspondence between the progression of the myth and
Phreedom's actions. That is about to change.
</p>
<h5 class="align-center">Inanna at the Gates of Hell</h5>
<p>
This canto alternates between Inanna's myth and Phreedom, with each
in the corresponding typeface. The correspondence between the two is
becoming more explicit: as Inanna answers the gate guard's questions
with lies, so Phreedom gives a fake identity card at the check-in
desk, and their jewelery and accessories are itemised in parallel
lists.
</p>
<h5 class="align-center">Broken Minutes and Bent Hours</h5>
<p>
This canto contains two verses of Inanna's story followed by two of
Phreedom's, in the corresponding typefaces. However for the first time
a paragraph of Phreedom's (in the modern typeface) intrudes on a chunk
of Inanna's (in the mythic typeface): Phreedom leaving her hotel room
without her motorcycle helmet appears to correspond to Inanna having
her crown taken from her.
</p>
<p>
The interwoven paragraph is further distinguished from its context by
being set in italics. I suspect that the switch from one roman serif
to another was considered (either by Hal or his editor) too subtle and
too likely to be missed by the reader, so was given this extra
emphasis: we will see this technique again in Volume 2 when Jack Carter
investigates his grandfather's journey to the Kur.
</p>
<h5 class="align-left">A Speck of Dirt Under a Fingernail</h5>
<p>
Here the tidy categorisation breaks down, so completely that I suspect
a publishing error. The first verse starts with two italicised
paragraphs from Inanna's myth, then ends with a paragraph of
Phreedom's story. Phreedom's paragraph is in the modern typeface;
following the pattern of the mixed-typeface chunk in &ldquo;Broken
Minutes and Bent Hours&rdquo;, we would expect Inanna's myth to come
in the (italics of the) mythic typeface. Inexplicably, however, it too
is in Phreedom's modern typeface.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the canto follows Phreedom, and is (unsurprisingly) in
the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Angels on Your Body</h5>
<p>
This canto exactly follows the pattern of the previous, including
the interwoven quote from Inanna's myth but in the (italicised) modern
typeface. These interwoven quotes (in this and subsequent cantos)
concern the removal of each of Inanna's marks of authority and power
(jewelry, fine clothing, and similar), one by one. With each removal
she asks, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; and is answered, &ldquo;Quiet,
Inanna, the customs of the city of the dead are perfect. They may not
be questioned.&rdquo;
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Hunter Seeker</h5>
<p>
This canto again follows the same pattern, and again the interwoven
paragraphs from Inanna's myth are in italics but the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">The Resonance of Another Moment</h5>
<p>
Three of the four verses in this canto contain interwoven quotes
from Inanna's myth, and again these paragraphs are in the modern
typeface but set out by being italicised. This completes the removal
of Inanna's protections.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Naked and Bowed Low</h5>
<p>
The first verse of this canto returns to Inanna's myth in the mythic
typeface. As there is only one typeface in the chunk, there is no need
for italics to reinforce the distinction, so we return to roman. The
remaining verses concern Phreedom and are in the modern typeface, as
expected.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Phreedom at the Gates of Hell</h5>
<p>
This canto follows Phreedom only, and is in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>
<p>
With only one exception, all the &ldquo;Errata&rdquo; sections of the
book are entirely in the modern typeface. They frequently follow on
from the Prologue (Reynard Carter on the Road of All Dust), which
shared the same typeface.
</p>

<h3>2: The War Against Romance</h3>
<p>
This chapter concerns Phreedom and Finnan, and is set in the modern
typeface (as is its &ldquo;Errata&rdquo; section): nothing unexpected
here.
</p>

<h3>3: All Eternity or Nothing</h3>
<p>This chapter returns to the mythic typeface for the capture of
Tammuz, and makes the first use of the mundane typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">A Vague But Passionate Way</h5>
<p>
Modern Thomas and modern Finnan, in the modern typeface.
</p>
<h5 class="align-left">Destination Apocalypse</h5>
<p>The same.
</p>
<h5 class="align-left">The Voice of God</h5>
<p>
Modern Metatron, in the modern typeface.
</p>
<h5 class="align-right">Golden Apples and Green Leaves</h5>
<p>
The four verses of this canto continue the story of Inanna in the
mythic typeface. Inanna denounces her lover Tammuz, who is attacked by
the demons persuing her. He calls on Shamash (the god of justice) for
help in escaping, and then something odd happens: the text, while
remaining in the mythic typeface, leaves the original text entirely
behind to explicitly identify the characters Tammuz and Dumuzi,
escaping &ldquo;down into the eternal tales of transformation,
metamorphic, mythic&rdquo;. This is the first indication that the
typeface that we are calling &ldquo;mythic&rdquo; is not only for
explicit retelling of ancient myths; here it is used for a description
we might call &ldquo;deep in the Vellum&rdquo;, at the level of mythic
archetypes and correspondences.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Carrion Comfort</h5>
<p>
Despite this possibility, Thomas's flight &ldquo;into the
Vellum&rdquo; (and through time) is here set in the modern typeface:
he is still the character from 2017 (not a &ldquo;deeper&rdquo;
archetype) and his travels, while non-linear in time, appear to be
nominally linear as concerns his own experience.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">The Lioness and the Gazelle</h5>

<p>
A verse of Sumerian myth in the mythic typeface is followed by a verse
of deliberate ambiguity: &ldquo;Tassili-n-Ajer or Lascaux, 10,000 BCE
or today.&rdquo; The typeface is mythic, but distinguished from the
first: it is also italicised. It describes both a rock painting, and
the original scene it depicts.
</p>

<p>Next we see the first appearance of the mundane typeface, as an
as-yet-unnamed voice (it is Seamus Finnan in the trenches of WWI)
speaks to &ldquo;Tommy boy&rdquo; (identified with Phreedom's brother
Thomas but also with Tammuz and Dumuzi). The following verse redoubles
the ambiguity: set in &ldquo;Tassili-n-Ajer or Lascaux, 1916 or
today&rdquo; it gives a variation on the 10,000 BCE verse, describing
the same (ambiguous) painting and the moment Thomas sees it. In
parallel to the first ambiguous description, this is in the mundane
typeface but italicised.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Yellow Paper and Brown Pencil Lines</h5>
<p>
Seamus and Tommy, in the mud of the trenches, in the mundane
typeface. We see Tommy begin to succumb to shellshock.
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">Dumuzi’s Dream</h5>
<p>
In parallel, in the mythic typeface, Dumuzi relates a prophetic dream
of death.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">The Great White Hunter</h5>
<p>
In three verses we follow Tommy/Thomas and Seamus as the shells land
around them and Thomas cracks up, but in the fourth (also in the
mundane typeface) a hunter shoots at a Thomson's gazelle (linked in
earlier imagery to both Tommy and Tammuz/Dumuzi) and misses.
</p>

<p>
The typeface here is thus more than simply indicating the thread of
continuity: from Hal we understand that is serves to indicate the
&ldquo;modernist technique&rdquo; (i.e. the text as text, not the action
described therein) as he described on twitter.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Mad Jack Carter</h5>
<p>
In the mundane typeface, we meet Thomas' commanding officer, Mad Jack Carter. 
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Objects Out of History</h5>
<p>
We alternate between verses of the myth of Tammuz, in the mythic
typeface, and verses in the mundane typeface concerning Professor
Samuel Hobbsbaum. It seems to be Hobbsbaum's translation of the myth
that we are reading, and we seem to be seeing him in the process of
translating it.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Given to the Winds</h5>
<p>
The first verse appears to be from Hobbsbaum's perspective; it
discusses the complications of the myth of Inanna, but in somewhat
academic terms, and it is set in the mundane typeface.
</p>

<p>
In the next verse we see a return to the puzzling structure first seen
in &ldquo;Broken Minutes and Bent Hours&rdquo;. The bulk of the verse
is in the modern typeface and concerns Phreedom and her brother
Thomas, but the first paragraph is a quote from the myth, set in
italics but still in the modern typeface. Again, I am inclined to
consider this a mistake: the thematically coherent version would put
his paragraph in the mythic typeface (if perhaps italicised to
increase the contrast with the rest of the verse).
</p>
  
<p>
The third verse, in the mundane typeface, makes explicit that
Hobbsbaum is retelling Dumuzi's tale. And the final verse repeats the
problematica structure but in the mundane typeface: an italicised
quote from the myth and a roman paragraph about Hobbsbaum, but all set
in mundane instead of using the mythic typeface for the mythic
material.
</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>
<p>
The errata, as (almost) always, are in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h3>4: Gravings of Destiny</h3>
<h5 class="align-center">A Sister of Sorts</h5>
<p>
In parallel we see descriptions of Inanna and Eresh (in the mythic
typeface) and a conversation between Phreedom (who will become
identified with Inanna via the &ldquo;graving&rdquo; referred to in
the chapter title) and the tattooist Madame Iris (who either simply is
Eresh, survived to the modern day, or is identified with her by the
same kind of graving). The typefaces help the reader keep track while
verses from these two threads alternate.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Animal Hide Painted with Ochre</h5>

<p>
The graving itself is in the modern typeface, described from
Phreedom's point of view.
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">An Empty Role of Rituals</h5>

<p>
The first three verses of this canto are in the mundane typeface,
while the last returns to Phreedom's perspective and the modern
typeface. The mundane verses describe Inanna, but
the <em>historical</em> Inanna, the &ldquo;young girl of the neolithic
village whose real history is buried there inside that
tale&rdquo;. This is a particularly subtle and surprising use of the
typefaces, to alert the reader that this &ldquo;Inanna&rdquo; is not
necessarily the same person that we have previously heard referred to
with that name.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">The Answerers</h5>

<p>
In this canto we see Phreedom preparing an artificial intelligence
to act as her representative if her visit to Madame Iris (the modern
parallel to Inanna's descent into hell) should go
wrong. Unsurprisingly, it is set in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">The Temple of Lord Ilil</h5>

<p>
The first verse of this canto mixes elements of Inannas' myth with
Phreedom's story. It uses the modern typeface for both, with the
mythic elements italicised (the same structure I have criticised
repeatedly above).
</p>

<p>
In the remaining verses, the wheels fall off the thematic analysis
entirely. We see a virtual reality museum tour conducted by a
limited-reactivity software agent, and attended by the artificial
intelligence Phreedom created in &ldquo;The Answerers&rdquo;, now
referred to interchangeably as &ldquo;Lady Shubur&rdquo;, from
Inanna's myth, and &ldquo;Lady Cypher&rdquo;. Against all expectation,
though, this material is set not in the modern typeface (of Phreedom's
story, of the modern-futuristic world and cyberpunk) but in
the <em>mundane</em> typeface. I am at a loss to explain this
decision; at the very least, it should serve as a reminder that
&lsquo;mundane&rdquo; is more a label of convenience than a
description.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Lady Shubur’s Lament</h5>

<p>
Here we see three verses of modern typeface showing Phreedom and
other, presumably contemporary, echoes of Lady Shubur (a girl at a
santera ceremony, a Christian exorcism), along with a further glimpse
of Lady Cypher in the mundane typeface. The first verse interweaves a
piece of the myth in italicised modern typeface, but this case can be
read as contemporary quoting: &ldquo;The words [you have just read]
carve themselves in Phreedom's flesh&rdquo;.
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">The Houses of the Gods</h5>

<p>
This canto follows Lady Shubur/Cypher as she asks help from Enlil,
one-time Father of the Gods. It perhaps throws some light on why the
mundane typeface was used for this material. It takes place &ldquo;out
of time and not quite in eternity&rdquo;; Enlil's &ldquo;own soul is
broken up and buried, surviving only in the odd fragments of a
patriarachal archetype, here and there[&hellip;]. There's a new
Godfather with his own temple, his own story, and Ilil is just a
footnote in his text, a brick used in the new lord's house.&rdquo; The
mythic typeface would be inappropriate, despite the mythic identities
of the entities involved, because these events are not
&lsquo;deep&rsquo;: they do not have reverberations throughout history
(at most, they <em>are</em> the reverberations of deeper events). It's
less clear why the modern typeface could not be used; perhaps simply
because a distinction was needed between the Lady Cypher material and
Phreedom's experience of the graving, which will be interleaved in the
next canto.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">In a Dark Eye</h5>

<p>
Lady Cypher in the mundane typeface, Phreedom in the modern. I'm
guessing it's this kind of alternation which made it impossible to put
Lady Cypher's material in the modern typeface, where it arguably
otherwise belongs (set in motion by Phreedom, originally
futuristic/cyberpunk, and anything but mundane!).
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">A Spiderweb Collage</h5>

<p>
Lady Cypher in the mundane typeface, with the same semi-justification as before. 
</p>

<p>
Lady Cypher and Phreedom alternating again, with their corresponding typefaces.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">The Illusion Fields</h5>

<p>
Pure Phreedom, in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">A Sleeve of Blood and Black</h5>

<p>
A verse of the mundane typeface: &ldquo;She was born Ninanna Belili
[&hellip;] daughter of a neolithic chieftain&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
A verse of the modern typeface: &ldquo;the girl who used to be called
Phreedom&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
A verse of the mythic typeface: &ldquo;She was born Inanna, queen of
heaven, priestess of the earth&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
And a final verse, in the modern typeface, in which Madame Iris (in
the tattoo parlour with Phreedom) reflects on what qualities Inanna's
archetype has.
</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>
Modern Metatron in the modern typeface.
</p>


<h3>5: The Fields of Lost Days</h3>
<h5 class="align-center">Crossroads, 1937</h5>

<p>
In the mundane typeface, but this canto references the story that
Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Dogs of Kingship</h5>

<p>
Various avatars of Thomas are pursued in the modern typeface,
interleaved with Dumuzi being pursued in the mythic typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Sweet Little Pink Things</h5>

<p>
Phreedom, in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">His Long, Thin Fingers</h5>

<p>
Within these verses parts of Phreedom's and Finnan's brutalisation by
Carter and Pechorin are interleaved with corresponding parts of the
search for Dumuzi. As seen before in such interleavings, the mythic
elements are placed in the modern typeface, but in italics &mdash;
even, here, in one case where they form the only content of an entire
chunk.
</p>


<h5 class="align-center">The Ditches of Arali, the Trenches of the Somme</h5>

<p>
In the first verse mythic material runs into Seamus and Tommy in the
trenches mid-sentence; the entire verse is in the mundane typeface,
with the mythic material italicised.
</p>

<p>
But then the next verses alternate between the mythic typeface (for
Dumuzi's myth) and the mundane typeface (for Seamus and Tommy). There
seems to be an inconsistency between the treatment in this canto and
in &ldquo;His Long, Thin Fingers&rdquo;.
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">Dumuzi’s Capture</h5>

<p>
The parallel stories of Tommy and Dumuzi, told again in alternating
verses of mythic and mundane typefaces.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">A War of Ideals</h5>

<p>
Thomas (Phreedom's brother) in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">No More Gods</h5>

<p>
The same.
</p>

<h5 class="align-right">The Lost Deus of Sumer</h5>

<p>
The climax of the stories of Tommy and Dumuzi, told again with Dumuzi
in the mythic typeface and Tommy in the mundane. Elements of the myth
interleave into Tommy's verse, in italics.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">The Sebitti</h5>

<p>
Metatron in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">In the Silvery Steel of a Cigarette Lighter</h5>

<p>
Carter and Pechorin, as modern agents of Metatron, in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">The River of Crows and Kings</h5>

<p>
Here we have again the mundane typeface used for material that is
decidely not mundane: the river of the canto title, and a version of
Thomas/Tammuz that seems to tie together every echo and avatar yet
seen. It might be that &ldquo;modernist&rdquo; is a better label, but
that doesn't seem right to me either: this passage is quite explicitly
about mythic resonances and eternally repeating stories. I can only
shrug.
</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>
Modern typeface, as with most errata sections.
</p>

<h3>6: The Passion of Every Thomas</h3>

<h5 class="align-left">The Crucified Shepherd</h5>

<p>
Phreedom and Finnan (who we now know is the same Seamus Finnan of
Tommy's story) in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">A Ragdoll or a Scarecrow <em>and further</em></h5>

<p>
In the mundane typeface, describing the death of Puck, Thomas
Messenger (although not the same person as Phreedom's brother, despite
having the same name), from the point of view of his lover.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this chapter continues in the mundane typeface, giving the
back story to their relationship; the setting is an alternative world
in which Gnomes, Fairies, Ogres and similar take the roles of the
human races we know.
</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>This errata section, as usual, is in the modern typeface.</p>

<h3>7: Black Lines of Our Doom</h3>

<h5 class="align-left">The Angel Metatron</h5>

<p>
This chapter follows Metatron, and is mainly in the modern
typeface. This canto includes excerpts from Inanna's tale, but they
are garbled: Metatron is reading them on his laptop, which is infected
with Phreedom's Lady Cypher. As these are modern echoes of the
original myth, and scrambled besides, it makes sense that they are in
the modern typeface as well (although distinguished by italics).
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Creatures of Earth</h5>

<p>Phreedom, in the modern typeface.</p>


<h5 class="align-left">The Ghost in the Machine</h5>

<p>Metatron and Lady Cypher, in the modern typeface.</p>

<h5 class="align-left">A Terrible Innocence</h5>

<p>
Metatron, in the modern typeface. This canto again contains parts of
Inanna's myth in italics, but again they are to be interpreted as read
by Metatron.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">The Very Darkest Purple</h5>

<p>
Metatron, Carter and Pechorin, in the modern typeface, again with
echoes of Inanna's myth. Here it is less clear if they are to be
interpreted as read by Metatron or as original, but they are still in
the (italicised) modern typeface.
</p>


<h5 class="align-center">The Throne Room of the Queen of Hell</h5>

<p>
Here the chunkverses alternate between Inanna's myth (in the mythic
typeface) and the arrival of Carter and Pechorin at the tattoo parlour
(in the modern typeface).
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">The Wineskin on the Hook</h5>

<p>
Modern typeface, unsurprisingly as this is now Phreedom's story. There
are also still echoes of Inanna's myth interwoven, in italics.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Inanna Rose</h5>

<p>
The pivotal moment in which Enki's bitmites mix with Eresh's bottled
unkin blood, and the entire canto is in the modern typeface: this is
Phreedom's story, despite whatever connection it might have to Inanna.
</p>

<h5 class="align-left">Frozen Between Eternity and Now</h5>

<p>
Likewise with the moment of her escape, taking Eresh's book of
gravings with her.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Dressed in Soiled Sackcloth</h5>

<p>
Here Inanna's myth returns, in verses (in the mythic typeface)
alternating with Phreedom's (in the modern typeface).
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">A Door Out of Reality</h5>

<p>
Likewise. Phreedom appears to have escaped, but by the correspondences
with Inanna's myth we know that tragedy is approaching.
</p>

<h5 class="align-center">Through the Long Grass</h5>

<p>
In this last canto of the chapter, we see Inanna's myth (in which
she denounces Tammuz to escape the demons that have followed her from
the underworld) in the mythic typeface, and Phreedom's story (in which
she offers her brother the chance to escape his fate, and he refuses
to take it), in the modern typeface.</p>


<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>This errata section is in the modern font.</p>

<a name="volume-2"></a>
<h2>Volume two: Evenfall Leaves</h2>

<p>
For the second volume I have kept my more detailed descriptions at the
chapter level. Since some continuities persist across multiple
chapters, something can be said here with even less detail. Here are
the basic continuities, with their choice of typeface, that we will be
concerned with:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Endhaven. This is an easy one: it appears only in the Eclogue and
Epilogue, and is always in the mundane typeface.</li>
<li>Errata: another easy one, these are (with one exception) all still
in the modern typeface.</li>
<li>Seamus Finnan's history. This also appears in the mundane
typeface, but modern material (and sometimes the modern typeface)
increasingly intrudes: he is being forced to relive old memories
during a modern interrogation. The one exception to the rule that
Errata are always modern is a flash of Seamus's history.</li>
<li>The interrogation itself is in the modern typeface, and typically
interweaves with his history.</li>
<li>Mad Jack Carter's expedition to the Kur in 1921 is in the mundane
typeface. The historical material must be read as being transcribed
(or placed in a scrapbook with annotations, or similar) by his
grandson, whose additional notes surrounding the 1920s material (and
culminating with his own trip to the Kur) appear in the modern
typeface.</li>
<li>The psychoanalysis of Jack Flash weaves together <em>four</em>
typefaces, which begin as entirely distinct and end as a single
continuity.</li>
<li>Phreedom's journey through the Vellum continues to use the modern
typeface, but increasingly often the mythic typeface makes its
appearence as well: in the Song of Silence, but also in the Ballad of
Seamus Finnan. In both cases the border between the &lsquo;modern
Phreedom&rsquo; and the &lsquo;mythical Phreedom&rsquo; is
increasingly difficult to draw.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eclogue: The Song of Silence</h3>

<p>The eclogue introduces Endhaven in the mundane typeface; we will
return there in the epilogue.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the chapter weaves together two related continuities:
Phreedom in the Vellum (in the modern typeface) and the Song of
Silence (in the mythic typeface). At first these are given separate
cantos, but gradually the rhythm of alternation speeds up: in
&ldquo;The Liquid Light of Language&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Paradox of
Patrios&rdquo; they take alternating <em>verses</em>, and in
&ldquo;The Golden Age Returns&rdquo; each verse about Silence (in the
mythic typeface) ends with a paragraph about Phreedom (in the modern
typeface). By the final canto the regular structure has broken down,
and we have: a verse in the mythic typeface; a verse with both mythic
and modern material, each in its typeface; a verse in the modern
typeface; and a verse in the mythic typeface, about Silence, but that
refers to him singing in &ldquo;Ivan's sports bar grill and
steakhouse&rdquo; which appears to be the venue that Phreedom has just
left. The perspective alternation has sped up to the point of actual
identification of the two continuities; we will see this technique
again when Jack Flash breaks out of his psychoanalysis.
</p>

<p>
The Errata section returns to the modern typeface.
</p>

<h3>1: The Hammers of Hephaestos</h3>
<p>
The interrogation of Seamus Finnan, from two temporal
perspectives. One, in the mundane typeface, follows from WWI, taking
in some of his trench experiences, his treatment for shell-shock, and
his political activism in Scotland. The other, in the modern typeface,
is Finnan the unkin, tied to a chair in a freezing slaughterhouse and
interrogated by the bitmites. There is no mixing of typefaces within a
single canto, and the rhythm of alternation is rather slow: typically
more than one canto in the same typeface/continuity before the next
switch.
</p>

<p>
The Errata section, in the modern typeface, concerns Metatron and two
versions of Carter and Pechorin who have featured in this chapter; one
version appears in the chapter in the mundane typeface, but here both
are in the modern typeface.
</p>


<h3>2: Prometheus Found</h3>

<p>
This chapter uses the mundane and modern typefaces to distinguish two
threads of continuity: an expedition by Mad Jack Carter in 1921, and
his grandson (who shares his name) in 1999 investigating the
expedition.
</p>

<p>
The 1921 continuity is contextualised as historical materials which
the modern Jack Carter has received in the post, and given in the
mundane typeface. His investigations are described in the modern
typeface, and sometimes intrude on the historical materials: In
&ldquo;Dear N., the letter reads. A piece of good luck&hellip;&rdquo;
the letter is in the mundane typeface (&ldquo;Dear N. A piece of good
luck&hellip;&rdquo;) while the annotation &ldquo;the letter
reads&rdquo; is in the italicised modern typeface. The annotations
continue, e.g., &ldquo;I don't know who N. is or how my grandfather
and namesake came into posession of this letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Errata section concerns Guy Reynard and Puck on the road of all
dust, and is in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h3>3: Of Mammon and Moloch</h3>

<p>
This chapter weaves together <em>four</em> typefaces, describing three
threads of continuity, all set in an alternative future Britain cast
as a fascist steampunk colonial power. &ldquo;Jumpin' Jack
Flash&rdquo; gives Jack Flash's viewpoint, describing the acts of
violent sabotage that lead to his capture: this thread is in the
mundane typeface. After his capture he is examined by a Dr Reinhardt
Starn (starting with &ldquo;Weapons-Grade Adamantium&ldquo;), who
suspects him of faking schizophrenia: this thread is in the modern
typeface. The third thread of continuity, which can be seen in
&ldquo;A Glint of Snickety-Sharp Teeth&rdquo;, introduces the last two
typefaces: a sans-serif for the &ldquo;mindworm&rdquo; inhabiting
Pechorin, who is observing Jack's interviews with Starn from behind a
one-way mirror, and the mythic typeface for what are at first
presented as Jack's memories, stirred up and directed by the mindworm.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter the three continuities remain distinct, alternating
canto by canto.
</p>

<p>
The errata section concerns Reynard and Puck, and Phreedom and Don,
and is in the modern typeface.
</p>

<h3>4: The Scythes of Cronos</h3>

<p>
We return to Seamus's interrogation, again using the mundane typeface
for 1920s material and the modern typeface for Finnan the unkin and
the bitmites. Now, though, the modern material recontextualises the
1920s: not as a literal thread of continuity, but as Finnan's
memories, called up and modified, during his interrogation.
</p>

<p>
Mostly each canto sticks to a single one of the two threads. In one
exception, Don MacChuill (who is playing a part in Finnan's induced
memories, trying to get him to let the information they want slip)
&ldquo;jerks both hand and mind away from the prisoner&rdquo;: this
verse is in the modern typeface, while the rest of the canto (in the
1920s continuity) was in the mundane typeface. In a second exception,
the modern Finnan (who by now is aware of what kind of interrogation
he is undergoing) suffers a series of flashbacks through 1920s
material, cast as a single paragraph of the mundane typeface, that
switches back to the modern typeface as &ldquo;he drags himself back
out of it, back into the present&rdquo;, for the rest of the canto.
</p>

<p>
The modern material does not follow a linear timeline, but includes
<em>modern</em> flashbacks: Seamus and Phreedom, after Thomas's death
but before the interrogation started. The typeface implies that this
is backstory for the reader, and not memories stirred up by the
bitmites during the interrogation.
</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>
Most of this Errata section is in the modern typeface, but it also
(uniquely among the Errata sections of either volume) contains some
material in the mundane typeface. In &ldquo;The Heart of
Damascus&rdquo; Carter, interrogating Finnan, discovers where Thomas
is, and the view switches mid-verse to WWI (in the mundane typeface),
then again to a different Carter and Pechorin (back in the modern
typeface), each shift apparently continuing the same action despite
the new context.
</p>

<h3>5: Narcissus Has Woken</h3>

<p>
This chapter continues, and complicates, the psychoanalysis of Jack
Flash. As before, Starn's interview is in the modern typeface, the
mindworm-induced memories are in the mythic typeface (with the
mindworm itself in a san-serif), and Jack Flash's first-person
description of his situation is in the mundane typeface.
</p>

<p>
Now, though, individual cantos may contain more than one of these
viewpoints. Jack Flash, in the mundane typeface, &ldquo;let[s his]
psychic guard slip for a second&rdquo; and is apparently hypnotised by
a Rorschach ink blot, after which the canto continues with verses in
the modern typeface from Starn's perspective. In another canto the
interview material (in the modern typeface) bleeds immediately back
into the mindworm's continuity (san-serif and mythic typeface) as it
convinces the mindworm that Jack is &ldquo;armed and dangerous&rdquo;
and instigates another attempt at memory control.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in &ldquo;Dreamtime's Up&rdquo;, the three threads weave
together into a single continuity. First parts of Starn's interview
appear (in the modern typeface) in verses under the mindworm's control
(in the mythic typeface). Then Jack Flash (in the mundane typeface)
gives a direct answer to a mindworm directive, which until now has
always prompted memories given in the mythic typeface. All four
typefaces occur in a single verse as Jack Flash takes over his
analysis/interrogation.
</p>

<p>
The final canto of the chapter returns to the mundane typeface and
Jack Flash's first-person narration (with a verse in san-serif showing
the collapse of the mindworm), establishing that this was the
&lsquo;offical&rsquo; or &lsquo;real&rsquo; continuity all along.
</p>

<p>
The errata section, as always, is in the modern typeface. It concerns
a different Jack suffering from schizophrenia, and Reynard and Puck
and the hominid they call Jack on the road of all dust.
</p>

<h3>6: Echoes of Iapetus</h3>

<p>
This chapter continues the 1921 expedition of Mad Jack Carter (in the
mundane typeface) and the 1999 investigation of the expedition by his
grandson (in the modern typeface). As before, the modern Jack Carter
occasionally intrudes on the historical materials (in one case to
explain what is meant by the phonetic term &ldquo;voiceless&rdquo;),
and these intrusions are set in the modern typeface (in italics where
they appear in a paragraph that is otherwise in the mundane
typeface). From the canto titled &ldquo;Childe Roland&rdquo; onwards
we are following the <em>modern</em> Jack Carter, who has retraced his
grandfather's steps to the Kur. Both of these continuities are written
as diary entries, by men who share the same name, and who have now
reached the same physical location and are making the same
discoveries: while there are textual clues that establish their
identities, the typefaces are quite useful in keeping the threads
distinct.
</p>

<p>
The errata section returns to the usual modern typeface.
</p>

<h3>7: Zeus Irae</h3>

<p>
This chapter continues the interrogation of Seamus Finnan: as before,
the 1920s material is in the mundane typeface while the modern
material is in the modern typeface. Now, though, the modern world is
started to bleed into the 1920s: the bitmites speak to him <em>in the
mundane typeface</em> and he suffers what appear (to his 1920s self)
to be visions but what are actually memories of later events.
</p>

<p>
But a third thread of continuity also appears: Don and Phreedom,
travelling through the Vellum, hear a song called &ldquo;The Ballad of
Seamus Finnan&rdquo;. These passages are set in the mythic typeface.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the chapter, the material in the mundane typeface is no
longer cast as an interrogation. It is simply giving Finnan's history,
as he fought against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War: this
aligns thematically with his resistance to the Covenant in the modern
material.
</p>

<h3>Epilogue: Endhaven, Evenfall</h3>

<p>
The epilogue, with Tom and Jack in Endhaven, is entirely set in the
mundane typeface.
